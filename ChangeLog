 v2.00 - 07 Mar 2003
   This version works correctly with Slackware 9.0rc1 and above
   Upgrade script is now template. This allows easier customizations
   MD5 sums and digital signatures of the packages are checked before upgrading
   Important packages (glibc, elflibs) are upgraded first
   In case of error (checksum, no free space, etc) upgrade is stopped immediately
   List of hosts can be set using --host or --file switches

 v1.00 - 05 Jan 2003
   Download package list from slackware mirror
   Generate "smart" upgrade scripts that download packages
   Automatic upgrade mode - this allows easy upgrading of many machines at once
   Manual upgrade mode - just copy upgrade scripts to machines
