 v3.30 - 29 January 2005
   Do not try to upgrade aaa_elflibs package. As Pat's says, this package
   should be installed initially and then never upgraded. For more info
   see Slackware-current ChangeLog from Mon Jan 24 20:41:03 PST 2005

   An example has been added on how to use slackcheck to update packages
   using Slackware CD (see config.sh)

 v3.20 - 02 June 2004
   A bug was fixed that was preventing correct checksum validation when two
   packages have the same names but are in different directories.
   A bug was fixed that prevented updating system that has no modutils
   installed.

 v3.10 - 06 January 2004
   Fix stupid bug that prevents --local from working when slcheck is run from
   root account.

 v3.00 - 05 January 2004
   New option that allows upgrade of local machine only. Help was improved by
   adding more examples and better description of available program options.
   A workaround has been added for the aaa_elflibs package in -current.

 v2.80 - 05 September 2003
   A workaround has been added for the module-init-tools package in -current.

 v2.70 - 12 June 2003
   A workaround has been added for the utempter package in slackware-current.

 v2.60 - 25 May 2003
   A workaround has been added for the coreutils package in slackware-current.

 v2.50 - 18 Apr 2003
   Rewritten detection of updated packages. The logic now is less error prone.

 v2.40 - 09 Apr 2003
   Use CHECKSUMS.md5 from / directory. This allows patches/ directory to be
   scanned also. Please update your config.sh file!
   Fix wrong md5 sums file generation.
   Don't use non-verbose mode for wget. It's broken in the latest wget release.

 v2.30 - 16 Mar 2003
   Remove checks for program existence if xxx_CHECK features are not used.
   Replace hardcoded check for wget with correct check for $DL_PRG.

 v2.20 - 11 Mar 2003
   Added workaround for sed. Longer explanation: sed was split out of bin
   package so upgrading bin package caused pkgtools to stop working. The
   workaround prevents this by checking if sed is useful after each upgradepkg.

 v2.10 - 10 Mar 2003
   Added "smart upgrade". When this function is enabled, slackcheck will run
   'lilo' when lilo or kernel packages are upgraded. Without this your system
   can be left unbootable.
   Fixes for MD5 and signature checks.

 v2.00 - 07 Mar 2003
   This version works correctly with Slackware 9.0rc1 and above
   Upgrade script is now template. This allows easier customizations
   MD5 sums and digital signatures of the packages are checked before upgrading
   Important packages (glibc, elflibs) are upgraded first
   In case of error (checksum, no free space, etc) upgrade is stopped immediately
   List of hosts can be set using --host or --file switches

 v1.00 - 05 Jan 2003
   Download package list from slackware mirror
   Generate "smart" upgrade scripts that download packages
   Automatic upgrade mode - this allows easy upgrading of many machines at once
   Manual upgrade mode - just copy upgrade scripts to machines
